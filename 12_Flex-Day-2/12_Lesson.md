# Flex Day 2

Same with Flex Day 1, if it doesn't happen here, and we need to place it earlier, that's fine. This day is meant to be flexible and open to the needs of the students.

If you are all caught up, then you can use today to plan the project you will be building the next two weeks.

Explore the scope, who will do what, and what technologies you will be using, etc.

You can even set up the repositories so we have two full weeks of implementing AI into building an application very very fast.
