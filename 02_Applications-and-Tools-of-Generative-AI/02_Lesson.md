### What you'll learn

### Terminology & Concepts

- **Adaptive learning**: A personalized learning approach that adjusts the pace, content, and delivery of educational materials based on individual learner needs and preferences.

- **Sentiment analysis**: The process of determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in text or speech, often used to analyze public opinion or customer feedback.

- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: A subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP techniques are used to process, understand, and generate human language.

- **Multimodal Models**: Models that can process and generate content in multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio. They combine different AI techniques to generate more diverse and rich content.

- **Style Transfer**: A technique in generative AI that involves extracting the style from one image and applying it to another, creating hybrid or fusion images. For example, converting a painting into a photograph.

- **Inpainting**: The process of reconstructing missing or damaged parts of an image using generative AI models. This technique can be used for art restoration, removing unwanted objects, or blending virtual objects into real-world scenes.

- **Outpainting**: The process of extending the original image by generating new parts that are like extensions of the original. This can be used for generating larger images, enhancing resolution, or creating panoramic views.

- **Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and understand complex patterns and relationships in data. Deep learning algorithms are capable of learning and making predictions from large amounts of data.
