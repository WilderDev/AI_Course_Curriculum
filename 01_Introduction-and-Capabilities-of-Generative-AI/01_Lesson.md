### What you'll learn

- Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is all set to transform the future of our society, impacting every facet of our work and daily lives.

- This course is your first step toward understanding the capabilities of generative AI powered by different models, including large language models (LLMs). Whether you are an enthusiast, a student, or a professional, this course provides a foundation to use generative AI for diverse use cases.

- In this module, you will learn the fundamentals of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and how it differs from discriminative AI. You will also discover the capabilities of generative AI for generating text, image, code, speech, and video as well as for data augmentation.

### Terminology & Concepts

- **Generative AI**: A type of artificial intelligence that generates new data instances that resemble the training data. It can mimic human creativity and generate new content, such as text, images, audio, and video.

  - Business can leverate generative AI to become more productive & profitable.
  - Individuals can leverate generative AI to increase productivity, add tangible value to their work, save money/time, and maximize their brand value.
  - _Examples_: Chatbots, virtual assistants, and content creation tools.

- **Discriminative AI**: A type of artificial intelligence that predicts the probability of a label given input data. It is used for classification and regression tasks.

  - Use advanced algorithms to differentiate between different classes of data, classify data, identify patterns, and draw insights.
  - _Examples_: Email spam filters, image recognition, and sentiment analysis.

- **Difference between Generative AI and Discriminative AI**: Generative AI generates new data instances, while discriminative AI predicts the probability of a label given input data.
