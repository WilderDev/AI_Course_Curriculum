### What you'll learn

The module includes a final project, which provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience on the concepts covered in the course. The module also includes optional content. This content includes the techniques for writing effective prompts for image generation.

### Terminology & Concepts

- **Style Modifiers**: Descriptors used to influence the artistic style or visual attributes of images produced by generative AI models. They can modify various visual elements like color, contrast, texture, shape, and size to generate aesthetically appealing and visually pleasing output.

- **Quality Boosters**: Terms used in an image prompt to enhance the visual appeal and improve the overall fidelity and sharpness of the output. They can include terms like high resolution, sharp focus, complimentary colors, and others to enhance specific features of the image.

- **Repetition**: A technique that involves emphasizing a particular visual element within an image prompt to create a sense of familiarity for the generative AI model. It helps in generating multiple images with subtle differences, resulting in a diverse set of potential outputs.

- **Weighted Terms**: Words or phrases that can have a powerful emotional or psychological impact. They can be given positive or negative weights to emphasize or de-emphasize certain emotions in the image prompt.

- **Fix Deformed Generations**: A technique used to modify any deformities or anomalies in the generated images. It involves using good negative prompts to mitigate issues like distortion, pixelation, or other image quality problems.

## LESSON

### Part 1: Text to Image Prompt Engineering

#### Exercise: Create a Futuristic Cityscape

In this exercise, you will prompt a generative AI model to create a cohesive project: a detailed and visually striking futuristic cityscape. We will guide you through setting up your environment, generating initial images, refining them using style modifiers, quality boosters, weighted terms, and fixing any anomalies.

#### Step 1: Set up the AI Environment

1. **Log into DALLE-2 or Midjourney:**

   - If you don't have an account, create one by following the platform's sign-up process.
   - Log into your account and navigate to the image generation section.

2. **Name the Project:**

   - Use the provided options to name your project, for example, "Futuristic Cityscape".

3. **Choose the Model:**
   - Select the appropriate image generation model, DALLE-2 or Midjourney, from the dropdown list or settings menu.

#### Step 2: Generate Initial Image from Text Prompt

1. **Provide Prompt Instructions:**

   - Use the platform’s instructions field to provide context for the required output. For example, type "High-resolution images of futuristic cityscapes" in the instructions field.

2. **Type Your Initial Message:**
   - Think of a basic image you would like to generate to start the project. Type the prompt "Image of a futuristic cityscape" in the text box.
   - Click the generate button to create the initial image.
   - Note: The image may take some time to generate.

#### Step 3: Refine Prompt Using Style Modifiers

1. **Understand Style Modifiers:**

   - Style modifiers influence the artistic style or visual attributes of the images. Some examples include Photographic, Animated, Digital Art, Comic Book, Fantasy Art, Line Art, Analog Film, Neon Punk, Isometric, and so on.

2. **Refine Your Prompt:**

   - Enhance your image by applying style modifiers. For example, type "Image of a futuristic cityscape in neon punk style" in the text box and click Send.
   - Observe the changes in the generated image.

3. **Experiment with Different Styles:**
   - Try refining your prompt with another style. For example, type "Image of a futuristic cityscape with a digital art style" in the text box and click Send.

#### Step 4: Try Combining Style Modifiers

1. **Combine Style Modifiers:**
   - Explore combining one or more style modifiers. For example, type "Animated, neon punk image of a futuristic cityscape" in the text box and click Send.
   - Experiment with different combinations to achieve the desired visual effect.

#### Step 5: Enhance Image Quality Using Quality Boosters

1. **Understand Quality Boosters:**

   - Quality boosters enhance the visual appeal and overall quality of the images. Examples include high-resolution, intricate details, hyper-detailed, sharp focus, complementary colors, and so on.

2. **Refine Your Prompt:**

   - Apply quality boosters to your prompt. For example, type "High-resolution, hyper-detailed image of a futuristic cityscape" in the text box and click Send.

3. **Combine Quality Boosters:**
   - Enhance your prompt with additional quality boosters. For example, type "Intricate details, sharp focus, and complementary colors in a futuristic cityscape" in the text box and click Send.

#### Step 6: Use Weighted Terms for Emphasis

1. **Understand Weighted Terms:**

   - Weighted terms allow you to emphasize or de-emphasize particular objects or emotions in an image. For example, specifying the number of elements or certain attributes can help guide the AI.

2. **Create a Detailed Prompt:**

   - For example, type "Depict a futuristic cityscape with five skyscrapers and three flying cars" in the text box and click Send.

3. **Experiment with Weighted Terms:**
   - Refine your prompt with specific terms. For example, type "A bustling futuristic cityscape with vibrant lights, seven skyscrapers, and multiple flying vehicles" in the text box and click Send.

#### Step 7: Fix Image Anomalies Using Negative Prompts

1. **Understand Negative Prompts:**

   - Negative prompts help rectify deformities or anomalies such as distortions, extra or missing elements, pixelation, etc.

2. **Identify and Fix Anomalies:**

   - Create a prompt that includes common issues you want to avoid. For example, type "A futuristic cityscape with no distorted buildings, no pixelation, and no blurry elements" in the text box and click Send.

3. **Experiment with Negative Prompts:**
   - Refine your image by focusing on other potential anomalies. For example, type "A futuristic cityscape without bad lighting, blurry areas, or distorted vehicles" in the text box and click Send.
