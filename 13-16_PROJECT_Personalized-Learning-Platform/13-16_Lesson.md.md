# Final Project: Personalized Learning Platform (Built with AI)

## PREVIEW

### What you'll learn

This project will help you create a personalized learning platform for software developers using ChatGPT.

It involves creating prompts that can be run in a generative AI classroom ChatGPT environment to build a learning platform that provides personalized learning recommendations based on existing courses.

You will explore using ChatGPT to gather requirements for the app, design tables and databases in MongoDB, and use prompts to generate code in Node and Express.js endpoints. You will observe how ChatGPT provides recommendations based on the generated code.

You will learn to generate test cases to test the endpoints of the code and, finally, create a Dockerfile for deploying the app. You can push the code to GitHub.

### Terminology & Concepts

- **Personalized Learning**: An approach to education and training that tailors the learning experience to the individual learner's needs, preferences, and prior knowledge.

- **Adaptive Learning**: An approach to education and training that adjusts the difficulty level and content of learning materials based on the learner's performance and progress.

## LESSON - Final Project (Next 2 Weeks w/ Group)

### Part 2: Configure MongoDB Server

_NOTE:_ MongoDB likes to change their API often, so you may need to update the code. When using AI, ensure you mention to use the latest API and even documentation if possible.

#### Step 1: Set Up MongoDB

_MongoDB will serve as the database for the personalized learning platform. Setting up MongoDB is the first step in crafting the server-side architecture._

1. Navigate to the MongoDB website and sign up for an account (if you don't have one already).
2. Create a new cluster in MongoDB Atlas and name it appropriately for your project.

#### Step 2: Configure Cluster

_After creating the cluster, you need to configure it for your application._

1. Add your IP address to the IP whitelist to allow access to the cluster.
2. Create a new database user with the appropriate roles and permissions.

#### Step 3: Obtain Connection String

_The connection string is required to connect your application to the MongoDB server._

1. Navigate to the Cluster overview page.
2. Click on the "Connect" button and follow the prompts to get the connection string.
3. Replace `<password>` with the password you created for your database user.

#### Step 4: Install MongoDB in Your Project

_Set up your project to use MongoDB by installing the necessary packages._

1. In your project directory, run the following command to install the MongoDB driver for Node.js:
   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```

#### Step 5: Configure Database Connection

_Create a file to manage the database connection in your Node.js project._

1. Create a file named `database.js` in your project directory.
2. Use the following code as a template to connect to MongoDB:

   ```javascript
   const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

   const uri = 'your_connection_string_here'; // Replace with your actual connection string
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
   });

   async function connectDB() {
     try {
       await client.connect();
       console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB', error);
     }
   }

   connectDB();

   module.exports = client;
   ```

#### Step 6: Test Database Connection

_Verify that your application can successfully connect to MongoDB._

1. Run your Node.js application using the following command:
   ```bash
   node database.js
   ```
2. Check the console output to confirm that the connection to MongoDB was successful.

#### Step 7: Define Database Schema

_Create schemas to define the structure of the data stored in MongoDB._

1. Decide on the data structure for the entities in your application (e.g., users, courses, learning paths).
2. Use Mongoose (a MongoDB object modeling tool) to define schemas for these entities:
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   ```
3. Create a file named `models.js` and define your schemas:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: String,
     email: String,
     password: String,
   });

   const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     title: String,
     description: String,
     content: String,
   });

   const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
   const Course = mongoose.model('Course', courseSchema);

   module.exports = { User, Course };
   ```

#### Step 8: Integrate Database with Backend

_Ensure your backend application can interact with the MongoDB database using the defined schemas._

1. In your backend code, import the models and use them to interact with the database.
2. Create endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on your data.

   ```plaintext
   I would like to create the user service. I would like to use Node.js and MongoDB for this project. How do I create a project structure and define the schema for the user service?
   ```
2. Review the response and identify the necessary fields for the user schema, such as `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`, etc.

#### Step 2: Set Up Project Structure

_Create the project structure for the User Service using Node.js and MongoDB._

1. Create the following directory structure:
   ```
   user-service/
   ├── config/
   ├── controllers/
   ├── models/
   ├── routes/
   ├── services/
   ├── index.js
   ├── package.json
   └── .env
   ```
2. Add the necessary files in each directory (e.g., `config/db.js`, `controllers/userController.js`, `models/user.js`, `routes/userRoutes.js`).

#### Step 3: Create User Schema

_Define the schema for the User Service in the `models` directory._

1. In `models/user.js`, define the User schema using Mongoose:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: { type: String, required: true },
     email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
     password: { type: String, required: true },
     role: { type: String, default: 'user' },
   });

   const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

   module.exports = User;
   ```

#### Step 4: Implement Database Connection (You might've already done this in Part 2)

_Set up the database connection in the `config` directory._

1. In `config/db.js`, add the following code to connect to MongoDB:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const dotenv = require('dotenv');

   dotenv.config();

   const connectDB = async () => {
     try {
       await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
         useNewUrlParser: true,
         useUnifiedTopology: true,
         useCreateIndex: true,
       });
       console.log('MongoDB connected');
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('MongoDB connection error:', error);
       process.exit(1);
     }
   };

   module.exports = connectDB;
   ```

#### Step 5: Create User Controller

_Implement the controller for handling user-related operations._

1. In `controllers/userController.js`, define functions for user operations such as registration and login:

   ```javascript
   const User = require('../models/user');

   const registerUser = async (req, res) => {
     const { name, email, password } = req.body;
     try {
       const user = new User({ name, email, password });
       await user.save();
       res.status(201).json({ message: 'User registered successfully' });
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error registering user' });
     }
   };

   const loginUser = async (req, res) => {
     const { email, password } = req.body;
     try {
       const user = await User.findOne({ email });
       if (user && user.password === password) {
         res.status(200).json({ message: 'User logged in successfully' });
       } else {
         res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
       }
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error logging in user' });
     }
   };

   module.exports = { registerUser, loginUser };
   ```

#### Step 6: Define User Routes

_Set up the routes for the User Service in the `routes` directory._

1. In `routes/userRoutes.js`, define the user-related routes:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const { registerUser, loginUser } = require('../controllers/userController');

   const router = express.Router();

   router.post('/register', registerUser);
   router.post('/login', loginUser);

   module.exports = router;
   ```

#### Step 7: Integrate Routes in Server

_Integrate the user routes in the main server file._

1. In `index.js`, set up the Express server and use the user routes:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const connectDB = require('./config/db');
   const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');
   const dotenv = require('dotenv');

   dotenv.config();

   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());

   connectDB();

   app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
   ```

#### Step 8: Test the User Service

_Ensure the User Service is working correctly._

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
2. Use a tool like Postman to test the registration and login endpoints:
   - `POST /api/users/register`
   - `POST /api/users/login`

#### Step 9: Determine Additional Schemas

_Use ChatGPT to identify other schemas needed for the personalized learning platform._

1. Type the following prompt:
   ```plaintext

   app.use('/api/courses', courseRoutes);

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
   app.listen(PORT, () =>
     console.log(`Course service running on port ${PORT}`),
   );
   ```

#### Step 4: Implement Feedback Service

_Create the feedback service to manage feedback-related operations._

1. In `models/feedback.js`, define the Feedback schema:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const feedbackSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     userId: {
       type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       ref: 'User',
       required: true,
     },

     }
   };

   const getFeedbacks = async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const feedbacks = await Feedback.find()
         .populate('userId')
         .populate('courseId');
       res.status(200).json(feedbacks);
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching feedbacks' });
     }
   };

   module.exports = { createFeedback, getFeedbacks };
   ```

3. In `routes/feedbackRoutes.js`, define the feedback routes:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const {
     createFeedback,
     getFeedbacks,
   } = require('../controllers/feedbackController');

   const router = express.Router();

   router.post('/create', createFeedback);
   router.get('/', getFeedbacks);

   module.exports = router;
   ```

4. In `index.js`, set up the Express server for the feedback service:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const connectDB = require('./config/db');
   const feedbackRoutes = require('./routes/feedbackRoutes');
   const dotenv = require('dotenv');

   dotenv.config();

   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());

   connectDB();

   app.use('/api/feedbacks', feedbackRoutes);

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
   app.listen(PORT, () =>
     console.log(`Feedback service running on port ${PORT}`),
   );
   ```

#### Step 5: Test the Endpoints

_Ensure the backend endpoints are working correctly._

1. Start the server for each service:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
2. Use a tool like Postman to test the endpoints for creating and fetching courses and feedbacks:
   - `POST /api/courses/create`
   - `GET /api/courses`
   - `POST /api/feedbacks/create`
   - `GET /api/feedbacks`

           ))}
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default FeedbackList;
   ```

#### Step 8: Set Up Routing

_Configure React Router to navigate between different pages._

1. Install React Router:
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```
2. In `src/App.js`, set up the routes:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
   import Navbar from './components/Navbar';
   import Home from './pages/Home';
   import Courses from './pages/Courses';

   import Feedback from './pages/Feedback';

   const App = () => {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Navbar />
         <Switch>
           <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
           <Route path="/courses" component={Courses} />
           <Route path="/course/:id" component={Course} />
           <Route path="/feedback" component={Feedback} />
         </Switch>
       </Router>
     );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

#### Step 9: Create Page Components

_Develop the main page components for the platform._

1. In `src/pages/Home.js`, create the Home page:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   const Home = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Welcome to the Learning Platform</h1>
         <p>Discover personalized learning experiences.</p>
       </div>

   import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

   const Course = () => {
     const { id } = useParams();
     return (
       <div>
         <CourseDetail />
         <FeedbackForm courseId={id} />
         <FeedbackList courseId={id} />
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Course;
   ```

4. In `src/pages/Feedback.js`, create the Feedback page:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   const Feedback = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Feedback</h1>
         <p>Thank you for your feedback!</p>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Feedback;
   ```

#### Step 10: Test the Frontend Interfaces

_Ensure the frontend interfaces are working correctly._

1. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Navigate through the application to ensure all pages and components are functioning as expected.

### Part 8: Integrate Frontend and Backend

#### Step 1: Set Up Proxy for API Requests

_Configure the React application to route API requests to the backend server._

1. In the React project directory, open the `package.json` file.
2. Add a proxy field to direct API requests to the backend server:
   ```json
   "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
   ```

#### Step 2: Update API Endpoints in Frontend

_Modify the frontend code to use the correct API endpoints for interacting with the backend._

1. In `src/components/CourseList.js`, update the API endpoint:

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     axios
       .get('/api/courses')
       .then((response) => setCourses(response.data))
       .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching courses:', error));
   }, []);
   ```

2. In `src/components/CourseDetail.js`, update the API endpoint:

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     axios
       .get(`/api/courses/${id}`)
       .then((response) => setCourse(response.data))
       .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching course:', error));
   }, [id]);
   ```

3. In `src/components/FeedbackForm.js`, update the API endpoint:

   ```javascript
   const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();
     try {
       await axios.post('/api/feedbacks/create', { courseId, comment, rating });
       alert('Feedback submitted successfully');
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error submitting feedback:', error);
     }
   };
   ```

4. In `src/components/FeedbackList.js`, update the API endpoint:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     axios
       .get(`/api/feedbacks?courseId=${courseId}`)
       .then((response) => setFeedbacks(response.data))
       .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching feedbacks:', error));
   }, [courseId]);
   ```

#### Step 3: Ensure CORS Configuration in Backend

_Ensure the backend server is configured to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests._

1. In each backend service (`user-service`, `course-service`, `feedback-service`), install the CORS middleware:

   ```bash
   npm install cors
   ```

2. In the main server file (`index.js`) of each service, add the CORS middleware:
   ```javascript
   const cors = require('cors');
   app.use(cors());
   ```

#### Step 4: Test Integration

_Verify that the frontend and backend are correctly integrated and functioning._

1. Start the backend servers for user, course, and feedback services:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
2. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Navigate through the application and perform actions such as viewing courses, submitting feedback, and verifying that data is correctly retrieved and stored in the backend.

#### Step 5: Handle Authentication and Authorization

_Implement user authentication and authorization to secure the endpoints._

1. In `user-service`, create authentication endpoints for login and registration.
2. Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for managing user sessions.
3. In the frontend, update the login and registration forms to handle authentication tokens.
4. Secure the backend routes using middleware to check for valid tokens.

#### Step 6: Implement Error Handling

_Ensure proper error handling and display error messages in the frontend._

1. In the frontend components, catch errors from API requests and display appropriate messages.

   ```javascript
   .catch(error => {
     console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
     setError('An error occurred while fetching data.');
   });
   ```

2. In the backend, send descriptive error messages for various failure scenarios.

#### Step 7: Optimize Performance

_Optimize the integration for better performance and user experience._

1. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
2. Use pagination for large datasets to reduce load times.
3. Minimize the number of API requests by combining multiple requests into a single call where possible.

### Part 9: Generate and Execute Test Cases

#### Step 1: Generate Test Cases Using ChatGPT

_Use ChatGPT to generate test cases for the backend and frontend functionalities._

1. Type the following prompt:
   ```plaintext
   Please help me generate test cases for the backend services (user, course, feedback) and the frontend components of a personalized learning platform.
   ```
2. Review the generated test cases and ensure they cover the critical functionalities such as user registration, login, course creation, feedback submission, etc.

#### Step 2: Implement Backend Test Cases

_Write test cases for the backend services using a testing framework like Mocha and Chai._

1. Install Mocha and Chai in each backend service:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev mocha chai
   ```

2. In the `user-service`, create a test file `test/user.test.js` and add test cases:

   ```javascript
   const chai = require('chai');
   const chaiHttp = require('chai-http');
   const server = require('../index');
   const User = require('../models/user');

   chai.use(chaiHttp);
   const { expect } = chai;

   describe('User Service', () => {
     beforeEach(async () => {
       await User.deleteMany({});
     });

     it('should register a new user', (done) => {
       const user = {
         name: 'John Doe',
         email: 'john@example.com',
         password: 'password123',
       };
       chai
         .request(server)
         .post('/api/users/register')
         .send(user)
         .end((err, res) => {
           expect(res).to.have.status(201);
           expect(res.body).to.have.property(
             'message',
             'User registered successfully',
           );
           done();
         });
     });

     it('should login an existing user', (done) => {
       const user = new User({
         name: 'John Doe',
         email: 'john@example.com',
         password: 'password123',
       });
       user.save((err, savedUser) => {
         chai
           .request(server)
           .post('/api/users/login')
           .send({ email: 'john@example.com', password: 'password123' })
           .end((err, res) => {
             expect(res).to.have.status(200);
             expect(res.body).to.have.property(
               'message',
               'User logged in successfully',
             );
             done();
           });
       });
     });
   });
   ```

3. Repeat similar steps to create test files for the `course-service` and `feedback-service`.

#### Step 3: Implement Frontend Test Cases

_Write test cases for the frontend components using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library._

1. Install Jest and React Testing Library in the React project:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```

2. In `src/components`, create a test file `CourseList.test.js` and add test cases:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
   import axios from 'axios';
   import CourseList from './CourseList';

   jest.mock('axios');

   test('renders courses from API', async () => {
     const courses = [
       { _id: '1', title: 'Course 1' },
       { _id: '2', title: 'Course 2' },
     ];
     axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: courses });

     render(<CourseList />);

     await waitFor(() => {
       expect(screen.getByText('Course 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
       expect(screen.getByText('Course 2')).toBeInTheDocument();
     });
   });
   ```

3. Repeat similar steps to create test files for other components such as `CourseDetail`, `FeedbackForm`, and `FeedbackList`.

#### Step 4: Execute Backend Test Cases

_Run the backend test cases using Mocha._

1. Add a test script to the `package.json` file in each backend service:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "mocha --exit"
   }
   ```

2. Execute the test cases:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

#### Step 5: Execute Frontend Test Cases

1. Add a test script to the `package.json` file in the React project:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "jest"
   }
   ```

2. Execute the test cases:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

#### Step 6: Analyze Test Results

_Review the test results and ensure all test cases pass successfully._

1. Check the output of the test runs for both backend and frontend tests.
2. Identify and fix any failing test cases.
3. Re-run the tests until all cases pass.

#### Step 7: Integrate Continuous Testing

_Set up continuous integration to automate the testing process._

1. Choose a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Travis CI.
2. Create a configuration file for the chosen CI/CD tool to run tests on every push or pull request.
3. Ensure the CI/CD pipeline reports the test results and notifies the team of any failures.
