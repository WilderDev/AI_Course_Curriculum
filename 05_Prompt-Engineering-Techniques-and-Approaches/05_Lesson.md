### What you'll learn

In this module, you will discover techniques for skillfully crafting prompts that effectively steer generative AI models. You will also learn about various prompt engineering approaches that can enhance the capabilities of generative AI models to produce precise and relevant responses.

### Terminology & Concepts

- **Zero-shot Prompt**: A prompt that allows an AI model to generate a response for a task it has not been explicitly trained on.

- **Few-shot Prompt**: A prompt that enables an AI model to generate a response for a task with limited training examples.

- **Interview Pattern**: A prompt engineering approach that involves simulating a conversation or interview-style interaction with the AI model.

- **Chain-of-Thought**: A prompt engineering approach that builds on the previous response generated by the AI model to create a coherent chain of prompts and responses.

- **Tree-of-Thought**: A prompt engineering approach that branches out the prompts and responses into a tree-like structure to explore different paths of conversation.
