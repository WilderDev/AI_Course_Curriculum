## LESSON

### Part 1: Popular Tools of Generative AI for Software Development

#### Step 1: Setting Up a Simple Project with ChatGPT

1. **Login to ChatGPT**

   - Visit [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and log in using your credentials. Familiarize yourself with the interface and explore how ChatGPT can be used for generating text.

1. **Define the Project Goal**

   - For this exercise, we will develop a simple weather forecasting app using generative AI tools to assist with various stages of development. The project goal is to create a user-friendly app that fetches weather data and displays it in a readable format.

1. **Using ChatGPT for Project Planning**
   - Prompt ChatGPT to outline a basic plan for your weather forecasting app. For example:
     - **Prompt**: "ChatGPT, can you help me outline a basic project plan for a weather forecasting app?"
     - **Expected Output**: A detailed project plan with steps like setting up the project environment, fetching weather data from an API, processing the data, and displaying it to users.

#### Step 2: Writing Code with GitHub Copilot

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

   - Install Visual Studio Code and the GitHub Copilot extension. Ensure your development environment is ready for writing Python code.

2. **Generate Initial Code Snippets**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for fetching weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
     - **Example Task**: Write a function to fetch weather data.
     - **Prompt**: "GitHub Copilot, generate a Python function to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API."
     - **Expected Output**: A function in Python that uses the requests library to fetch weather data from the API.

#### Step 3: Enhancing the App with GPT-4

1. **Improve Code Quality**

   - Use GPT-4 to review and enhance the code quality. Prompt GPT-4 to suggest improvements for better performance and readability.
     - **Prompt**: "GPT-4, can you review this Python function and suggest improvements for better performance?"
     - **Expected Output**: Refined code with suggestions for optimization and best practices.

2. **Add Error Handling**
   - Ask GPT-4 to help add robust error handling to the weather data fetching function.
     - **Prompt**: "GPT-4, how can I add error handling to this weather fetching function?"
     - **Expected Output**: Modified code with try-except blocks and proper error messages.

#### Step 4: Utilizing Watsonx.ai for Data Analysis

1. **Analyze Weather Data**

   - Use Watsonx.ai for analyzing and processing the fetched weather data. Implement functions to calculate averages, detect trends, or identify anomalies in the weather data.
     - **Prompt**: "Watsonx.ai, analyze this weather data and provide insights on temperature trends over a week."
     - **Expected Output**: Analysis of weather data showing temperature trends, averages, and anomalies.

2. **Integrate Analysis Results**
   - Integrate the analysis results into the weather app, displaying the insights to users in a clear and concise manner.
     - **Prompt**: "Watsonx.ai, provide code snippets to display temperature trends and anomalies in the weather app."
     - **Expected Output**: Code snippets for displaying analysis results in a user-friendly format.

#### Step 5: Testing and Refining with Bard

1. **Test the App Functionality**

   - Use Bard to test the overall functionality of the weather forecasting app. Ask Bard to simulate user interactions and identify any issues.
     - **Prompt**: "Bard, test the functionality of this weather forecasting app and identify any potential issues."
     - **Expected Output**: Feedback on the app's functionality, identifying any bugs or user experience issues.

2. **Refine the User Interface**
   - Ask Bard for suggestions on improving the app's user interface and user experience.
     - **Prompt**: "Bard, how can I improve the user interface of my weather forecasting app for better user experience?"
     - **Expected Output**: Suggestions for UI/UX improvements, including layout changes, color schemes, and usability enhancements.

### Part 2: Tokenization in Generative AI

#### Step 1: Understanding Tokens

1. **Define Tokens and Token Limits**

   - **What are Tokens?** Tokens are fragments or segments of words used by AI models to process and generate text. They do not necessarily align with word boundaries and can include trailing spaces or sub-words.
   - **Token Limits:** For example, models like GPT-3.5-turbo have a token limit of 4097 tokens, shared between the input (prompt) and the output (completion). Understanding these limits is crucial for optimizing your prompts.

2. **Exploring Tokens**
   - **Token Conversion:** Understand how tokens are created and used. The AI model converts text input into tokens, processes them, and then generates an output by converting predicted tokens back into text.
   - **Example:** The word "red" can be tokenized differently based on context, such as " red" (with a leading space) or as part of a longer word.

#### Step 2: Token Tools and Counting Tokens

1. **Identify Token Tools**

   - **Interactive Tokenizer Tool:** Use the OpenAI interactive tokenizer tool to calculate the number of tokens in a given text and observe how it is broken down.
   - **Programmatic Tokenization:** For developers, Tiktoken is a fast BPE tokenizer designed for OpenAI models. Other libraries include the transformers package for Python and the gpt-3-encoder package for Node.js.

2. **Count Tokens**

   - **Steps to Count Tokens:**

     1. Identify the API endpoint you plan to call.
     2. Review the API documentation for request and response structures.
     3. Check if the API requires token-based authentication and obtain an access token if needed.
     4. Count tokens for each API call, including the access token in the request header.
     5. Track your token usage to stay within any usage limits or quotas.

   - **Example:**
     - For a GET request to `https://api.example.com/users/{userId}` with parameters `userId=123` and `includeAddress=true`:
       - The request method 'GET' counts as 1 token.
       - The query parameter 'includeAddress' and its value 'true' count as 2 tokens.
       - Total: 3 tokens.

#### Step 3: OpenAI Guidelines for Token Count

1. **Token Estimation:**

   - 1 token ≈ 4 characters in English
   - 1 token ≈ ¾ words
   - 100 tokens ≈ 75 words
   - 1-2 sentences ≈ 30 tokens
   - 1 paragraph ≈ 100 tokens
   - 1,500 words ≈ 2048 tokens

2. **Example Calculation:**
   - **Input Prompt:** "Can you provide a brief overview of the benefits of exercise?" (9 words)
     - Number of tokens ≈ 9 / 0.75 ≈ 12 tokens
   - **Output Generation:** Assuming 500 words
     - Number of tokens ≈ 500 / 0.75 ≈ 667 tokens

#### Step 4: Estimating AI Costs

1. **Calculating Costs:**

   - **Example:** For an input prompt of 12 tokens and an output of 667 tokens using GPT-3.5-turbo:
     - Cost for input: \( \frac{12}{1000} \times \$0.001 = \$0.000012 \)
     - Cost for output: \( \frac{667}{1000} \times \$0.002 = \$0.001334 \)
     - Total cost: \$0.000012 + \$0.001334 = \$0.001346

2. **Scaling Costs:**
   - **Example:** For 1000 API calls per day:
     - Daily cost: 1000 \times \$0.001346 = \$1.346
     - Monthly cost: \$1.346 \times 30 ≈ \$40.38

#### Step 5: Current Pricing of AI Models

1. **Pricing Chart:**
   - **GPT-4 Turbo:**
     - Input: \$0.01 / 1K tokens
     - Output: \$0.03 / 1K tokens
   - **GPT-4:**
     - Input: \$0.03 / 1K tokens
     - Output: \$0.06 / 1K tokens
   - **GPT-3.5-Turbo:**
     - Input: \$0.001 / 1K tokens
     - Output: \$0.002 / 1K tokens
   - **Code Interpreter:**
     - \$0.03 / session
   - **DALL·E 3:**
     - Standard: \$0.040 / image (1024×1024)
     - HD: \$0.080 / image (1024×1024)
