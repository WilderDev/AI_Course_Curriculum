## LESSON

### Part 1: Write a Dockerfile for a Node App Deployment

#### Step 1: Introduction to Dockerfile

1. **What is a Dockerfile?**

   - A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image for your application. It includes commands to set up the operating system, install dependencies, and configure the environment.

2. **Why use a Dockerfile?**
   - Dockerfiles enable developers to create a consistent and reproducible environment for their applications, ensuring that the software runs the same way on different machines. This facilitates easier collaboration, testing, and deployment.

#### Step 2: Understanding the Requirements for a Dockerfile

1. **Base Image Selection**

   - The first step in creating a Dockerfile is selecting a base image, which serves as the starting point for your Docker image. For a Node.js application, the base image is typically an official Node.js image from Docker Hub.

2. **Defining the Working Directory**
   - The working directory inside the container is where the application code will reside. Setting this directory ensures that all subsequent instructions are executed within this context.

#### Step 3: Creating the Initial Dockerfile

1. **Selecting the Base Image**

   - Enter the following instruction:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     ```
   - This command pulls the official Node.js version 14 image from Docker Hub.

2. **Setting the Working Directory**
   - Enter the following instruction:
     ```Dockerfile
     WORKDIR /app
     ```
   - This command sets the working directory to `/app` inside the container.

#### Step 4: Adding Project Files

1. **Copying the Package Files**

   - Enter the following instructions:
     ```Dockerfile
     COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
     ```
   - These commands copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to the working directory. These files are essential for installing project dependencies.

2. **Installing Dependencies**
   - Enter the following instruction:
     ```Dockerfile
     RUN npm install
     ```
   - This command runs `npm install` to install the project dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

#### Step 5: Adding Application Code

1. **Copying the Application Code**
   - Enter the following instruction:
     ```Dockerfile
     COPY . .
     ```
   - This command copies the entire application code from your local machine to the working directory inside the container.

#### Step 6: Configuring the Application

1. **Exposing the Application Port**

   - Enter the following instruction:
     ```Dockerfile
     EXPOSE 3000
     ```
   - This command exposes port `3000` on the container, making the Node.js application accessible on this port.

2. **Setting the Start Command**
   - Enter the following instruction:
     ```Dockerfile
     CMD ["node", "app.js"]
     ```
   - This command specifies the command to start the Node.js application when the container is run. Replace `app.js` with the entry point of your application.

#### Step 7: Combining All Steps

1. **Complete Dockerfile**
   - Combine all the steps to form the complete Dockerfile:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
     RUN npm install
     COPY . .
     EXPOSE 3000
     CMD ["node", "app.js"]
     ```
   - This complete Dockerfile will build a Docker image for your Node.js application, ensuring it runs consistently in any environment.
