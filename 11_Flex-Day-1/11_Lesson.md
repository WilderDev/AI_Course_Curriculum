# Flex Day 1

I wanted this day to be open in-case of holidays, need for review on a particular lesson, if you weren't able to finish a lesson, or if you wanted to go back and review a lesson.

It can also be used to explore a topic the students have asked a lot about that isn't covered in the curriculum.

Also, the last lesson (Lesson 10) is rather long, so if you need to split it up, this is a good place to do that.
